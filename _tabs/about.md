Hi

My name is Leontin Chiru. I am a network engineer. I like to learn new things about technologies and science..
I usually try to understand how everything is working and why.

I have almost 20 years of experience working in IT, mostly with networks devices and protocols but also programming, automation, databases, etc.
I learned a lot during theses years but I have little experience in writing down my ideas.

This site will mainly be my exercise for writing, and I hope it will be useful for anyone reading it.
I will start with a few easy topics but I want to move on to more advanced ones.

Any kind of feedback will be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you want me to write about something specific. I would be happy to do it.

Thank you!
